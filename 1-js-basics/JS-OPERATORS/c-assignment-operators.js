// The second category we are going to look at is the assignment operators.

// Here we are using the simple assignment operator to assign a value, in this case 10 to x.

let x = 10;

// The assignment operator is indicated by the = sign.

// We have a few more assignment operators.

// In the previous lesson, we learnt about the increment operator.

// With this we increment the value of x by 1.

x++;
x = x + 1;

//The expression x++; is exactly equivalent to x = x+1; , so wwe read the value of x, and add 1 to it and then using the assignment operator, assign this new value to x.

// What if we want to add let's say 5 to x? this increment operator will not work.

// We use a short hand way ,we can use the addition,assignment operator like this.

x +=5;  // This is exactly the same as x = x + 5;

// Let's say we want to multiple the value  of x by 3, we can write it like this;

x = x *3;

// Or we can use multiplication,assignment operator like this, x *= 3;


// All the other arithmetic operators we have learnt in the previous lesson like addition,subtraction,division,multiplication, and remainder operators, all of them have this combination with the assignment operator.
