// Let's take a look at comparison operators.

// As the name implies we use these operators to compare the value of a variable with something else.

// Here we have x equals to 1.

let x = 1;

console.log(x > 0); // This is the greater than comparison operator.

// The result of abn expressionn, that includes a comparison operator is a boolean,it's true or false.

console.log(x >= 1); // outputs true
console.log(x < 1); // outputs false ,because x is not less than 1
console.log(x <= 1); // outputs true

// These four operators here ,we refer to them as relational operators.

// We also have Equality operators and they are indicated by triple equal signs ===.

console.log(x === 1); // checks to see if x is equals to 1.We get true on the console.

// If we want to check if x is not equal to a given value,we replace the first equal sign with an exclamation mark ! 

console.log(x !== 1); // This outputs false because x is equal to 1.

// These are all the comparison operators in Javascript.
