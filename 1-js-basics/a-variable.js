// A variable is temporarily location for storing data for future use.

// How to create a variable.

// We define a variable using the keywords like let,const,var.

// We declare the variables in Javascript like this;

let name = 'Iqra';

// let is used as a keyword to declare the variable and so does var and const.

// If we want to declare multiple variables in Javascript there are two ways.

// The first way is to declare them on the same line like this below.

let firstName = 'Iqra', lastName = 'Issack';

// separated them by a comma when declaring them on the same line.


// The second way which is the modern best practice is to declare them on differnt lines.We terminate the first declaration with a semicolon and declare the second variable on a new line.


let firstName = 'Iqra';
let lastName = 'Issack';


// A constant is a data item whose value cannot change,when we dont want our variable's value to change we use constant instead.

// We declare a constant using the keyword const in Javascript.

const interestRate = 0.3;
console.log(interestRate);
