//In the previous lesson we learnt about primitive types.In this lesson we will learn about reference types.


// In reference type category we have the following types.

//Objects
//Arrays
//Functions

// We will focus on objects in this lesson.

// An object in Javascript is a container for named values called properties.

// When dealing with multiple related variables, we can put these variables inside an object.

let name = 'Iqra';
let age = 30;

let person = { // we declare a person object using the keyword let.
   name:'Iqra',
   age :30
};


// Name and age are highly related variables ,because they are part of the representation of the person object.
// Instead of declaring two variables to represent a person we just using a person object.
