// In Javascript we have two  categories of types-Primitive types and Reference types.
 
// Primitive types also known as value types are the most basic data types in Javascript.

// Primitive types include;

// Strings
// Numbers
// Booleans 
// Undefined
// Null

// We declare all the these above types below using the keywors let.

let name = 'Iqra'; // This is called  a string literal.
let age = 30; //This is called a number literal.
let isApproved = true; //This is called Boolean literal.
let firstName = undefined; 
let selectedColor = null; 
console.log(typeof selectedColor);


// Name is a variable and it value is Iqra and this value's data type is string.

// Age is a variable name and its value is 30 which its data type is number.

// isApproved is a variable name and its value can either be true or false but in this case it is true ,so the type is boolean.

// firstName is a variable whose value is undefined and its type is undefined.

// selectedColor is a variable name whose value is null,and its type is object.
